Vijay Narayan: Country Head of Index Operations -

Index Operations:
    Index operations refers to the activities and processes involved in managing and maintaining an index. It's like taking care of a special list that shows how a group of companies or investments are doing together. Index operations include tasks such as selecting which companies or assets should be included in the index, deciding how much each company should count in the index, and updating the index regularly as things change.

    The goal of index operations is to make sure the index accurately reflects the performance of the companies or investments it represents. It involves collecting and processing data, ensuring the data is accurate and up-to-date, and making any necessary adjustments to the index. Index operations also involve working with teams and stakeholders to ensure the smooth functioning of the index.

    In summary, index operations is all about managing and maintaining the special list that shows how a group of companies or investments are doing together, so that investors and others can use it to understand the overall performance of that group.

    Index operations at Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), involves managing and maintaining special lists called indices. These indices group together specific companies or investments to show how they are performing collectively. As part of the team, my role would be to help ensure the accuracy and reliability of these indices. This includes selecting the companies to be included in each index, determining their weight or importance within the index, and regularly updating the indices to reflect changes in the market. By doing so, we provide investors and others with valuable information to understand how a group of companies or investments is performing as a whole
