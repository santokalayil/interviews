# Tell about myself
My name is Santo K Thomas, and I'm currently  working as an Associate Analyst at ICE Data Services, where I focus on developing the data automation pipelines and data science. I'm excited about the opportunity at ISS Stoxx, as it aligns with my growing interest in the finance industry, particularly index-related work.

At ICE, I've been instrumental in automating complex processes, such as index reconstitution and rebalancing. My role involves leveraging data science techniques to optimize these processes and extract valuable insights.

Before that, I was a Data Scientist at Ezetap, where I developed a strong foundation in data analysis and visualization. A highlight of my tenure was being a key member of the team that secured second place in an RBI hackathon. This experience showcased my ability to collaborate effectively under pressure and deliver innovative solutions. I also successfully built and deployed a data-driven solution that significantly impacted the business.

My freelance background further equipped me with a versatile skill set, including web development and data automation. This experience has been invaluable in understanding end-to-end data workflows.

I'm confident my technical abilities, combined with my eagerness to learn about index construction, make me a strong candidate for the Index Custom Calculation Services Analyst role. I'm eager to contribute to ISS Stoxx's mission and expand my knowledge in the financial domain.
